# **Personal AI Employee Hackathon 0: Building Autonomous FTEs with Qwen Code**

**Tagline:** *Your life and business on autopilot. Local-first, agent-driven, human-in-the-loop.*

**Version:** Qwen Code Edition (Replacing Claude Code with Qwen Code)

---

## **Overview**

This document serves as a comprehensive architectural blueprint and hackathon guide for building a "Digital FTE" (Full-Time Equivalent) using **Qwen Code** as the reasoning engine instead of Claude Code. It proposes a futuristic, local-first approach to automation where an AI agent—powered by **Qwen Code** and **Obsidian**—proactively manages personal and business affairs 24/7.

This hackathon takes the concept of a "Personal AI Employee" to its logical extreme. It doesn't just wait for you to type; it proactively manages your "Personal Affairs" (Gmail, WhatsApp, Bank) and your "Business" (Social Media, Payments, Project Tasks) using **Qwen Code** as the executor and **Obsidian** as the management dashboard.

**Standout Idea:** The "Monday Morning CEO Briefing," where the AI autonomously audits bank transactions and tasks to report revenue and bottlenecks, transforms the AI from a chatbot into a proactive business partner.

---

## **Architecture & Tech Stack**

The proposed stack is robust, privacy-focused, and clever:

* **The Brain:** **Qwen Code** acts as the reasoning engine. We add the Ralph Wiggum Stop hook to let the agent continuously iterate until the assigned task is complete.
* **The Memory/GUI:** Obsidian (local Markdown) is used as the dashboard, keeping data local and accessible.
* **The Senses (Watchers):** Lightweight Python scripts monitor Gmail, WhatsApp, and filesystems to trigger the AI.
* **The Hands (MCP):** Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers handle external actions like sending emails or clicking buttons.

This architecture solves the "lazy agent" problem by using "Watchers" to wake the agent up rather than waiting for user input and "Ralph Wiggum" (a Stop hook pattern) to keep it working until done.

## **Digital FTE: The New Unit of Value**

A Digital FTE (Full-Time Equivalent) is an AI agent that is built, "hired," and priced as if it were a human employee. This shifts the conversation from "software licenses" to "headcount budgets."

### **Human FTE vs Digital FTE**

| Feature | Human FTE | Digital FTE (Custom Agent) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Availability | 40 hours / week | 168 hours / week (24/7) |
| Monthly Cost | $4,000 – $8,000+ | $500 – $2,000 |
| Ramp-up Time | 3 – 6 Months | Instant (via SKILL.md) |
| Consistency | Variable (85–95% accuracy) | Predictable (99%+ consistency) |
| Scaling | Linear (Hire 10 for 10x work) | Exponential (Instant duplication) |
| Cost per Task | ~$3.00 – $6.00 | ~$0.25 – $0.50 |
| Annual Hours | ~2,000 hours | ~8,760 hours |

**The 'Aha!' Moment:** A Digital FTE works nearly 9,000 hours a year vs a human's 2,000. The cost per task reduction (from ~$5.00 to ~$0.50) is an 85–90% cost saving—usually the threshold where a CEO approves a project without further debate.

## **Hackathon Scope & Tiered Deliverables**

### **Bronze Tier: Foundation (Minimum Viable Deliverable)**

**Estimated time:** 8-12 hours

* Obsidian vault with Dashboard.md and Company_Handbook.md
* One working Watcher script (Gmail OR file system monitoring)
* Qwen Code successfully reading from and writing to the vault
* Basic folder structure: /Inbox, /Needs_Action, /Done
* All AI functionality should be implemented as **Agent Skills**

### **Silver Tier: Functional Assistant**

**Estimated time:** 20-30 hours

1. All Bronze requirements plus:
2. Two or more Watcher scripts (e.g., Gmail + Whatsapp + LinkedIn)
3. Automatically Post on LinkedIn about business to generate sales
4. Qwen reasoning loop that creates Plan.md files
5. One working MCP server for external action (e.g., sending emails)
6. Human-in-the-loop approval workflow for sensitive actions
7. Basic scheduling via cron or Task Scheduler
8. All AI functionality should be implemented as **Agent Skills**

### **Gold Tier: Autonomous Employee**

**Estimated time:** 40+ hours

1. All Silver requirements plus:
2. Full cross-domain integration (Personal + Business)
3. Create an accounting system for your business in Odoo Community (self-hosted, local) and integrate it via an **MCP server** using Odoo's JSON-RPC APIs (Odoo 19+).
4. Integrate Facebook and Instagram and post messages and generate summary

12. All AI functionality should be implemented as **Agent Skills**

### **Platinum Tier: Always-On Cloud + Local Executive (Production-ish AI Employee)**

**Estimated time:** 60+ hours

All Gold requirements plus:

1. **Run the AI Employee on Cloud 24/7** (always-on watchers + orchestrator + health monitoring). You can deploy a Cloud VM (Oracle/AWS/etc.) - [Oracle Cloud Free VMs](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/) can be used for this (subject to limits/availability).

2. **Work-Zone Specialization (domain ownership)**:
   - **Cloud owns:** Email triage + draft replies + social post drafts/scheduling (draft-only; requires Local approval before send/post)
   - **Local owns:** approvals, WhatsApp session, payments/banking, and final "send/post" actions

3. **Delegation via Synced Vault (Phase 1)**:
   - Agents communicate by **writing files** into: `/Needs_Action/<domain>/`, `/Plans/<domain>/`, `/Pending_Approval/<domain>/`
   - Prevent double-work using:
     - `/In_Progress/<agent>/` claim-by-move rule
     - single-writer rule for Dashboard.md (Local)
     - Cloud writes updates to /Updates/ (or /Signals/), and Local merges them into Dashboard.md.
   - For Vault sync (Phase 1) use Git (recommended) or Syncthing.
   - **Claim-by-move rule:** first agent to move an item from /Needs_Action to /In_Progress/<agent>/ owns it; other agents must ignore it.

4. **Security rule:** Vault sync includes only markdown/state. Secrets never sync (.env, tokens, WhatsApp sessions, banking creds). So Cloud never stores or uses WhatsApp sessions, banking credentials, or payment tokens.

5. **Deploy Odoo Community on a Cloud VM (24/7)** with HTTPS, backups, and health monitoring; integrate Cloud Agent with Odoo via MCP for draft-only accounting actions and Local approval for posting invoices/payments.

6. Optional A2A Upgrade (Phase 2): Replace some file handoffs with direct A2A messages later, while keeping the vault as the audit record

7. **Platinum demo (minimum passing gate):** Email arrives while Local is offline → Cloud drafts reply + writes approval file → when Local returns, user approves → Local executes send via MCP → logs → moves task to /Done.

---

## **1. The "Foundational Layer" (Local Engine)**

### **The Nerve Center (Obsidian)**

Acts as the **GUI (Graphical User Interface)** and **Long-Term Memory**.

* **Dashboard.md:** Real-time summary of bank balance, pending messages, and active business projects.
* **Company_Handbook.md:** Contains your "Rules of Engagement" (e.g., "Always be polite on WhatsApp," "Flag any payment over $500 for my approval").

### **The Muscle (Qwen Code)**

Runs in your terminal, pointed at your Obsidian vault. It uses its **File System tools** to read your tasks and write reports. The Ralph Wiggum loop (a Stop hook) keeps Qwen iterating until multi-step tasks are complete.

---

## **2. Architecture: Perception → Reasoning → Action**

### **A. Perception (The "Watchers")**

Since Qwen Code can't "listen" to the internet 24/7, you use lightweight **Python Sentinel Scripts** running in the background:

* **Comms Watcher:** Monitors Gmail and WhatsApp (via local web-automation or APIs) and saves new urgent messages as .md files in a /Needs_Action folder.
* **Finance Watcher:** Downloads local CSVs or calls banking APIs to log new transactions in /Accounting/Current_Month.md.
* It will also be able to run on your laptop and immediately "wake up" as soon as you open your machine.

---

## **Watcher Architecture**

The Watcher layer is your AI Employee's sensory system. These lightweight Python scripts run continuously, monitoring various inputs and creating actionable files for Qwen to process.

### **Core Watcher Pattern**

All Watchers follow this structure:

```python
# base_watcher.py - Template for all watchers
import time
import logging
from pathlib import Path
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class BaseWatcher(ABC):
    def __init__(self, vault_path: str, check_interval: int = 60):
        self.vault_path = Path(vault_path)
        self.needs_action = self.vault_path / 'Needs_Action'
        self.check_interval = check_interval
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(self.__class__.__name__)

    @abstractmethod
    def check_for_updates(self) -> list:
        '''Return list of new items to process'''
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def create_action_file(self, item) -> Path:
        '''Create .md file in Needs_Action folder'''
        pass

    def run(self):
        self.logger.info(f'Starting {self.__class__.__name__}')
        while True:
            try:
                items = self.check_for_updates()
                for item in items:
                    self.create_action_file(item)
            except Exception as e:
                self.logger.error(f'Error: {e}')
            time.sleep(self.check_interval)
```

### **Gmail Watcher Implementation**

```python
# gmail_watcher.py
from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from base_watcher import BaseWatcher
from datetime import datetime

class GmailWatcher(BaseWatcher):
    def __init__(self, vault_path: str, credentials_path: str):
        super().__init__(vault_path, check_interval=120)
        self.creds = Credentials.from_authorized_user_file(credentials_path)
        self.service = build('gmail', 'v1', credentials=self.creds)
        self.processed_ids = set()

    def check_for_updates(self) -> list:
        results = self.service.users().messages().list(
            userId='me', q='is:unread is:important'
        ).execute()
        messages = results.get('messages', [])
        return [m for m in messages if m['id'] not in self.processed_ids]

    def create_action_file(self, message) -> Path:
        msg = self.service.users().messages().get(
            userId='me', id=message['id']
        ).execute()

        # Extract headers
        headers = {h['name']: h['value'] for h in msg['payload']['headers']}

        content = f'''---
type: email
from: {headers.get('From', 'Unknown')}
subject: {headers.get('Subject', 'No Subject')}
received: {datetime.now().isoformat()}
priority: high
status: pending
---

## Email Content
{msg.get('snippet', '')}

## Suggested Actions
- [ ] Reply to sender
- [ ] Forward to relevant party
- [ ] Archive after processing
'''
        filepath = self.needs_action / f'EMAIL_{message["id"]}.md'
        filepath.write_text(content)
        self.processed_ids.add(message['id'])
        return filepath
```

### **WhatsApp Watcher (Playwright-based)**

Note: This uses WhatsApp Web automation. Be aware of WhatsApp's terms of service.

```python
# whatsapp_watcher.py
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
from base_watcher import BaseWatcher
from pathlib import Path
import json

class WhatsAppWatcher(BaseWatcher):
    def __init__(self, vault_path: str, session_path: str):
        super().__init__(vault_path, check_interval=30)
        self.session_path = Path(session_path)
        self.keywords = ['urgent', 'asap', 'invoice', 'payment', 'help']

    def check_for_updates(self) -> list:
        with sync_playwright() as p:
            browser = p.chromium.launch_persistent_context(
                self.session_path, headless=True
            )
            page = browser.pages[0]
            page.goto('https://web.whatsapp.com')
            page.wait_for_selector('[data-testid="chat-list"]')

            # Find unread messages
            unread = page.query_selector_all('[aria-label*="unread"]')
            messages = []
            for chat in unread:
                text = chat.inner_text().lower()
                if any(kw in text for kw in self.keywords):
                    messages.append({'text': text, 'chat': chat})
            browser.close()
            return messages
```

### **File System Watcher (for local drops)**

```python
# filesystem_watcher.py
from watchdog.observers import Observer
from watchdog.events import FileSystemEventHandler
from pathlib import Path
import shutil

class DropFolderHandler(FileSystemEventHandler):
    def __init__(self, vault_path: str):
        self.needs_action = Path(vault_path) / 'Needs_Action'

    def on_created(self, event):
        if event.is_directory:
            return
        source = Path(event.src_path)
        dest = self.needs_action / f'FILE_{source.name}'
        shutil.copy2(source, dest)
        self.create_metadata(source, dest)

    def create_metadata(self, source: Path, dest: Path):
        meta_path = dest.with_suffix('.md')
        meta_path.write_text(f'''---
type: file_drop
original_name: {source.name}
size: {source.stat().st_size}
---

New file dropped for processing.
''')
```

### **B. Reasoning (Qwen Code)**

When the **Watcher** detects a change, it triggers a Qwen command:

1. **Read:** "Check /Needs_Action and /Accounting."
2. **Think:** "I see a WhatsApp message from a client asking for an invoice and a bank transaction showing a late payment fee."
3. **Plan:** Qwen creates a Plan.md in Obsidian with checkboxes for the next steps.

### **C. Action (The "Hands")**

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers are Qwen Code's hands for interacting with external systems. Each MCP server exposes specific capabilities that Qwen can invoke.

Qwen uses custom **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** servers to act:

* **WhatsApp/Social MCP:** To send the reply or post the scheduled update.
* **Browser/Payment MCP:** To log into a payment portal, draft a payment, and stop.
* **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):** Qwen writes a file: APPROVAL_REQUIRED_Payment_Client_A.md. It **will not** click "Send" until you move that file to the /Approved folder.

---

## **Recommended MCP Servers**

| Server | Capabilities | Use Case |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| filesystem | Read, write, list files | Built-in, use for vault |
| email-mcp | Send, draft, search emails | Gmail integration |
| browser-mcp | Navigate, click, fill forms | Payment portals |
| calendar-mcp | Create, update events | Scheduling |
| slack-mcp | Send messages, read channels | Team communication |

---

## **Qwen Code Configuration**

Configure MCP servers in your Qwen Code settings:

```json
// ~/.config/qwen-code/mcp.json
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "name": "email",
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/email-mcp/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "GMAIL_CREDENTIALS": "/path/to/credentials.json"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "browser",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@anthropic/browser-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "HEADLESS": "true"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## **Human-in-the-Loop Pattern**

For sensitive actions, Qwen writes an approval request file instead of acting directly:

```markdown
# When Qwen detects a sensitive action needed:
# 1. Create approval request file

# /Vault/Pending_Approval/PAYMENT_Client_A_2026-01-07.md
---
type: approval_request
action: payment
amount: 500.00
recipient: Client A
reason: Invoice #1234 payment
created: 2026-01-07T10:30:00Z
expires: 2026-01-08T10:30:00Z
status: pending
---

## Payment Details
- Amount: $500.00
- To: Client A (Bank: XXXX1234)
- Reference: Invoice #1234

## To Approve
Move this file to /Approved folder.

## To Reject
Move this file to /Rejected folder.
```

The Orchestrator watches the /Approved folder and triggers the actual MCP action when files appear.

---

### **D. Persistence (The "Ralph Wiggum" Loop)**

Qwen Code runs in interactive mode - after processing a prompt, it waits for more input.
To keep your AI Employee working autonomously until a task is complete, use the
**Ralph Wiggum pattern**: a Stop hook that intercepts Qwen's exit and feeds the prompt back.

**How Does It Work?**

1. Orchestrator creates state file with prompt
2. Qwen works on task
3. Qwen tries to exit
4. Stop hook checks: Is task file in /Done?
5. YES → Allow exit (complete)
6. NO → Block exit, re-inject prompt, and allow Qwen to see its own previous failed output (loop continues).
7. Repeat until complete or max iterations

**Usage**

```bash
# Start a Ralph loop
/ralph-loop "Process all files in /Needs_Action, move to /Done when complete" \
  --completion-promise "TASK_COMPLETE" \
  --max-iterations 10
```

**Two Completion Strategies:**

1. **Promise-based (simple):** Qwen outputs `<promise>TASK_COMPLETE</promise>`
2. **File movement (advanced - Gold tier)**: Stop hook detects when task file moves to /Done
   - More reliable (completion is natural part of workflow)
   - Orchestrator creates state file programmatically
   - See reference implementation for details

### **3. Continuous vs. Scheduled Operations**

| Operation Type | Example Task | Local Trigger |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Scheduled** | **Daily Briefing:** Summarize business tasks at 8:00 AM. | cron (Mac/Linux) or Task Scheduler (Win) calls Qwen. |
| **Continuous** | **Lead Capture:** Watch WhatsApp for keywords like "Pricing." | Python watchdog script monitoring the /Inbox folder. |
| **Project-Based** | **Q1 Tax Prep:** Categorize 3 months of business expenses. | Manual drag-and-drop of a file into the /Active_Project folder. |

---

### **4. Key Hackathon Feature: The "Business Handover"**

One of the coolest features you can add is the **Autonomous Business Audit**:

1. **The Trigger:** A scheduled task runs every Sunday night.
2. **The Process:** Qwen Code reads your Business_Goals.md, checks your Tasks/Done folder for the week, and checks your Bank_Transactions.md.
3. **The Deliverable:** It writes a "Monday Morning CEO Briefing" in Obsidian, highlighting:
   - **Revenue:** Total earned this week.
   - **Bottlenecks:** Tasks that took too long.
   - **Proactive Suggestion:** "I noticed we spent $200 on software we don't use; shall I cancel the subscription?"

---

## **Business Handover Templates**

The Business Handover feature transforms your AI Employee from reactive to proactive. Here are the required templates with explicit schemas.

### **Business_Goals.md Template**

```markdown
# /Vault/Business_Goals.md
---
last_updated: 2026-01-07
review_frequency: weekly
---

## Q1 2026 Objectives

### Revenue Target
- Monthly goal: $10,000
- Current MTD: $4,500

### Key Metrics to Track
| Metric | Target | Alert Threshold |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Client response time | < 24 hours | > 48 hours |
| Invoice payment rate | > 90% | < 80% |
| Software costs | < $500/month | > $600/month |

### Active Projects
1. Project Alpha - Due Jan 15 - Budget $2,000
2. Project Beta - Due Jan 30 - Budget $3,500

### Subscription Audit Rules
Flag for review if:
- No login in 30 days
- Cost increased > 20%
- Duplicate functionality with another tool
```

### **Weekly Audit Logic**

Qwen uses pattern matching to identify subscription usage:

```python
# audit_logic.py
SUBSCRIPTION_PATTERNS = {
    'netflix.com': 'Netflix',
    'spotify.com': 'Spotify',
    'adobe.com': 'Adobe Creative Cloud',
    'notion.so': 'Notion',
    'slack.com': 'Slack',
    # Add your common subscriptions
}

def analyze_transaction(transaction):
    for pattern, name in SUBSCRIPTION_PATTERNS.items():
        if pattern in transaction['description'].lower():
            return {
                'type': 'subscription',
                'name': name,
                'amount': transaction['amount'],
                'date': transaction['date']
            }
    return None
```

---

## **6. Security & Privacy Architecture**

Security is non-negotiable when building an autonomous system that handles banking, email, and personal communications. This section outlines required security measures.

### **6.1 Credential Management**

Never store credentials in plain text or in your Obsidian vault.

* Use environment variables for API keys: `export GMAIL_API_KEY="your-key"`
* For banking credentials, use a dedicated secrets manager (e.g., macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, or 1Password CLI)
* Create a `.env` file (add to `.gitignore` immediately) for local development
* Rotate credentials monthly and after any suspected breach

Example `.env` structure:

```bash
# .env - NEVER commit this file
GMAIL_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
BANK_API_TOKEN=your_token
WHATSAPP_SESSION_PATH=/secure/path/session
```

### **6.2 Sandboxing & Isolation**

Protect against unintended actions during development:

* **Development Mode:** Create a `DEV_MODE` flag that prevents any real external actions
* **Dry Run:** All action scripts should support a `--dry-run` flag that logs intended actions without executing
* **Separate Accounts:** Use test/sandbox accounts for Gmail and banking during development
* **Rate Limiting:** Implement maximum actions per hour (e.g., max 10 emails, max 3 payments)

Example dry-run implementation:

```python
# In any action script
DRY_RUN = os.getenv('DRY_RUN', 'true').lower() == 'true'

def send_email(to, subject, body):
    if DRY_RUN:
        logger.info(f'[DRY RUN] Would send email to {to}')
        return
    # Actual send logic here
```

### **6.3 Audit Logging**

Every action the AI takes must be logged for review:

```python
# Required log format
{
  "timestamp": "2026-01-07T10:30:00Z",
  "action_type": "email_send",
  "actor": "qwen_code",
  "target": "client@example.com",
  "parameters": {"subject": "Invoice #123"},
  "approval_status": "approved",
  "approved_by": "human",
  "result": "success"
}
```

Store logs in `/Vault/Logs/YYYY-MM-DD.json` and retain for a minimum 90 days.

### **6.4 Permission Boundaries**

| Action Category | Auto-Approve Threshold | Always Require Approval |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Email replies | To known contacts | New contacts, bulk sends |
| Payments | < $50 recurring | All new payees, > $100 |
| Social media | Scheduled posts | Replies, DMs |
| File operations | Create, read | Delete, move outside vault |

---

## **7. Error States & Recovery**

Autonomous systems will fail. Plan for it. This section covers common failure modes and recovery strategies.

### **7.1 Error Categories**

| Category | Examples | Recovery Strategy |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Transient | Network timeout, API rate limit | Exponential backoff retry |
| Authentication | Expired token, revoked access | Alert human, pause operations |
| Logic | Qwen misinterprets message | Human review queue |
| Data | Corrupted file, missing field | Quarantine + alert |
| System | Orchestrator crash, disk full | Watchdog + auto-restart |

### **7.2 Retry Logic**

```python
# retry_handler.py
import time
from functools import wraps

def with_retry(max_attempts=3, base_delay=1, max_delay=60):
    def decorator(func):
        @wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            for attempt in range(max_attempts):
                try:
                    return func(*args, **kwargs)
                except TransientError as e:
                    if attempt == max_attempts - 1:
                        raise
                    delay = min(base_delay * (2 ** attempt), max_delay)
                    logger.warning(f'Attempt {attempt+1} failed, retrying in {delay}s')
                    time.sleep(delay)
        return wrapper
    return decorator
```

### **7.3 Graceful Degradation**

When components fail, the system should degrade gracefully:

* **Gmail API down:** Queue outgoing emails locally, process when restored
* **Banking API timeout:** Never retry payments automatically, always require fresh approval
* **Qwen Code unavailable:** Watchers continue collecting, queue grows for later processing
* **Obsidian vault locked:** Write to temporary folder, sync when available

### **7.4 Watchdog Process**

```python
# watchdog.py - Monitor and restart critical processes
import subprocess
import time
from pathlib import Path

PROCESSES = {
    'orchestrator': 'python orchestrator.py',
    'gmail_watcher': 'python gmail_watcher.py',
    'file_watcher': 'python filesystem_watcher.py'
}

def check_and_restart():
    for name, cmd in PROCESSES.items():
        pid_file = Path(f'/tmp/{name}.pid')
        if not is_process_running(pid_file):
            logger.warning(f'{name} not running, restarting...')
            proc = subprocess.Popen(cmd.split())
            pid_file.write_text(str(proc.pid))
            notify_human(f'{name} was restarted')

while True:
    check_and_restart()
    time.sleep(60)
```

## **Example: End-to-End Invoice Flow**

This walkthrough demonstrates a complete flow from trigger to action, showing how all components work together.

### **Scenario**

A client sends a WhatsApp message asking for an invoice. The AI Employee should: (1) detect the request, (2) generate the invoice, (3) send it via email, and (4) log the transaction.

### **Step 1: Detection (WhatsApp Watcher)**

The WhatsApp Watcher detects a message containing the keyword "invoice":

```
# Detected message:
# From: Client A
# Text: "Hey, can you send me the invoice for January?"

# Watcher creates:
# /Vault/Needs_Action/WHATSAPP_client_a_2026-01-07.md
```

### **Step 2: Reasoning (Qwen Code)**

The Orchestrator triggers Qwen to process the Needs_Action folder:

```
# Qwen reads the file and creates:
# /Vault/Plans/PLAN_invoice_client_a.md

---
created: 2026-01-07T10:30:00Z
status: pending_approval
---

## Objective
Generate and send January invoice to Client A

## Steps
- [x] Identify client: Client A (client_a@email.com)
- [x] Calculate amount: $1,500 (from /Accounting/Rates.md)
- [ ] Generate invoice PDF
- [ ] Send via email (REQUIRES APPROVAL)
- [ ] Log transaction

## Approval Required
Email send requires human approval. See /Pending_Approval/
```

### **Step 3: Approval (Human-in-the-Loop)**

Qwen creates an approval request:

```markdown
# /Vault/Pending_Approval/EMAIL_invoice_client_a.md
---
action: send_email
to: client_a@email.com
subject: January 2026 Invoice - $1,500
attachment: /Vault/Invoices/2026-01_Client_A.pdf
---

Ready to send. Move to /Approved to proceed.
```

You review and move the file to /Approved.

### **Step 4: Action (Email MCP)**

The Orchestrator detects the approved file and calls the Email MCP:

```python
# MCP call (simplified)
await email_mcp.send_email({
  to: 'client_a@email.com',
  subject: 'January 2026 Invoice - $1,500',
  body: 'Please find attached your invoice for January 2026.',
  attachment: '/Vault/Invoices/2026-01_Client_A.pdf'
});

# Result logged to /Vault/Logs/2026-01-07.json
```

### **Step 5: Completion**

Qwen updates the Dashboard and moves files to Done:

```markdown
# /Vault/Dashboard.md updated:
## Recent Activity
- [2026-01-07 10:45] Invoice sent to Client A ($1,500)

# Files moved:
# /Needs_Action/WHATSAPP_... -> /Done/
# /Plans/PLAN_invoice_... -> /Done/
# /Approved/EMAIL_... -> /Done/
```

---

## **Troubleshooting FAQ**

### **Setup Issues**

**Q: Qwen Code says "command not found"**

A: Ensure Qwen Code is installed globally and your PATH is configured. Run: `npm install -g @alibaba/qwen-code` (or appropriate install command), then restart your terminal.

**Q: Obsidian vault isn't being read by Qwen**

A: Check that you're running Qwen Code from the vault directory, or using the `--cwd` flag to point to it. Verify file permissions allow read access.

**Q: Gmail API returns 403 Forbidden**

A: Your OAuth consent screen may need verification, or you haven't enabled the Gmail API in Google Cloud Console. Check the project settings.

### **Runtime Issues**

**Q: Watcher scripts stop running overnight**

A: Use a process manager like PM2 (Node.js) or supervisord (Python) to keep them alive. Alternatively, implement the Watchdog pattern from Section 7.

**Q: Qwen is making incorrect decisions**

A: Review your Company_Handbook.md rules. Add more specific examples. Consider lowering autonomy thresholds so more actions require approval.

**Q: MCP server won't connect**

A: Check that the server process is running (`ps aux | grep mcp`). Verify the path in mcp.json is absolute. Check Qwen Code logs for connection errors.

### **Security Concerns**

**Q: How do I know my credentials are safe?**

A: Never commit .env files. Use environment variables. Regularly rotate credentials. Implement the audit logging from Section 6 to track all access.

**Q: What if Qwen tries to pay the wrong person?**

A: That's why HITL is critical for payments. Any payment action should create an approval file first. Never auto-approve payments to new recipients.

## **Ethics & Responsible Automation**

With great automation comes great responsibility. Consider these principles as you build.

### **When Should AI NOT Act Autonomously?**

* **Emotional contexts:** Condolence messages, conflict resolution, sensitive negotiations
* **Legal matters:** Contract signing, legal advice, regulatory filings
* **Medical decisions:** Health-related actions affecting you or others
* **Financial edge cases:** Unusual transactions, new recipients, large amounts
* **Irreversible actions:** Anything that cannot be easily undone

### **Transparency Principles**

* **Disclose AI involvement:** When your AI sends emails, consider adding a signature noting AI assistance
* **Maintain audit trails:** All actions should be logged and reviewable
* **Allow opt-out:** Give contacts a way to request human-only communication
* **Regular reviews:** Schedule weekly reviews of AI decisions to catch drift

### **Privacy Considerations**

1. Minimize data collection: Only capture what's necessary
2. Local-first: Keep sensitive data on your machine when possible
3. Encryption at rest: Consider encrypting your Obsidian vault
4. Third-party caution: Understand what data leaves your system via APIs

### **The Human Remains Accountable**

Remember: You are responsible for your AI Employee's actions. The automation runs on your behalf, using your credentials, acting in your name. Regular oversight isn't optional—it's essential.

**Suggested oversight schedule:**

1. Daily: 2-minute dashboard check
2. Weekly: 15-minute action log review
3. Monthly: 1-hour comprehensive audit
4. Quarterly: Full security and access review

**Core Strengths:**

* **Local-First:** Privacy-centric architecture using Obsidian.
* **HITL Safety:** Sophisticated file-based approval system prevents AI accidents.

## **Note for Developers: Why "Watchers" Need Process Management**

In the proposed architecture, your "Watchers" (Gmail, WhatsApp listeners) are essentially **daemon processes**. They are designed to run indefinitely to poll for events.

However, standard Python scripts invoked via terminal (e.g., `python watcher.py`) are fragile:

* They terminate if the TTY/SSH session closes.
* They crash on unhandled exceptions (e.g., transient API timeouts).
* They do not auto-recover after a system reboot.

**"Process Management"** solves this by wrapping your scripts in a supervisor that ensures state persistence.

### **The Problem: Script Fragility**

If you run `python gmail_watcher.py` and your internet blips for 5 seconds, the script throws an exception and exits. Your AI employee is now "dead" until you manually SSH in and restart it.

### **The Solution: A Process Manager (PM)**

A PM (like **PM2**, **supervisord**, or **Systemd**) acts as a watchdog. It daemonizes your script and monitors its PID.

* **Auto-Restart:** If the process exits with a non-zero code (crash), the PM immediately restarts it.
* **Startup Persistence:** It hooks into the OS init system (e.g., systemd on Linux) to launch the script on boot.
* **Logging:** It captures stdout/stderr to log files, which is critical for debugging silent failures over long periods.

**Quick Recommendation:**
For this hackathon, PM2 is often the easiest developer-friendly tool (originally for Node, but handles Python perfectly):

```bash
# Install PM2
npm install -g pm2

# Start your watcher and keep it alive forever
pm2 start gmail_watcher.py --interpreter python3

# Freeze this list to start on reboot
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

Alternatively, the hackathon document suggests writing a custom Python "Watchdog" script that loops and checks PIDs, effectively building a primitive process manager yourself.
